# MacGems
## Explore Macalester College

MacGems is an Android app relying on Firebase to provide Macalester College students with locations around campus. It promotes the sharing of experiences through commenting. Each building, lawn, and hidden corner around the campus will now be known and accessible to the student body, allowing for a full-blown college experience!
